# An Unexpected Encounter

On Monday, Dan, running a little late due to his quest for the perfect morning coffee, is summoned urgently to his boss's office. He braces himself, wondering what could warrant such a summons, especially since he's always been punctual with his work.

Entering the office cautiously, Dan is surprised to find not just his boss but also a young woman he doesn't recognize. His boss, visibly agitated, addresses him sharply. "Where have you been? We've been waiting for you for half an hour!"

Dan is puzzled; he has no recollection of any scheduled meeting. However, he decides it's not the right moment to point out this discrepancy to his already irate boss.

"This is Lilla Bakos, a journalist from The Budapest Times. She's writing an article about our company and has some questions about our AI assistant," his boss explains, introducing the woman.

Lilla Bakos, with a friendly smile, starts asking Dan questions about his work. Her questions, however, are quite basic and stereotypical, covering general topics about AI and smart homes. Dan, though initially enthusiastic to share his knowledge, soon finds the conversation tedious due to the lack of depth in her inquiries.

As the interview concludes, Lilla requests Dan's personal contact information. "I'd like to send you a draft of the article before it's published, to ensure there are no technical inaccuracies," she explains.

Dan, slightly bemused by the turn of events but seeing no harm, provides her with his contact details. The encounter with Lilla Bakos, though unexpected, doesn't strike him as significant at the moment...
