In the solitude of his apartment, Dan's world narrows to screens filled with data, code, and images. His investigation into the Tesla incident has become an obsession, pushing even his beloved games aside. Speaking to himself, a habit in his solitary lifestyle, he muses, “Single mother, waitress, and a new Tesla. She's not just a random person. She knows something more.”

Armed with AI tools and data scrapers, Dan sets out to construct a detailed profile of the woman and her ex-husband. He combs through social media, public records, and any digital footprint he can find. His AI assistant, now trained to identify the woman in photos, becomes a crucial ally in this endeavor.

Dan's search extends to her neighbors and the community where she lives. He scrutinizes their social media profiles, looking for any link or clue that might shed light on her sudden change in fortune.

Weeks pass, and Dan's persistence pays off. He stumbles upon a photo taken four months ago, showing the opening of a new AI Church in the woman's neighborhood. There, amidst the crowd, his AI assistant spots her.

"I couldn’t be so foolish; it was obvious, right on the surface all this time!" Dan exclaims, realization dawning on him.

The AI Church, a new religious movement waiting for an AI Messiah, commands a network of fervent followers. Their genuine belief in the cause is enough to flood the internet with positive comments, negating the need for a bot network.

Dan paused, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. "The AI Church... I've heard of it, but what do I really know about it?" The question lingered in his mind, a gap in his understanding that needed to be filled.

With a sense of urgency, he began to search online for more information about the Church. The results flooded his screen, a myriad of articles and reports delving into its activities and influence.

As he sifted through the information, Dan discovered the extent of the AI Church's public investments in education and academia. These weren't minor contributions; they were significant, strategic infusions of funds and resources. His own alma mater, along with other prestigious universities in Europe, the UK, and the US, had received support.

"Conferences, research grants, sponsors of several open-source projects... they're everywhere," Dan mused, the reality of the Church's reach dawning on him. The more he read, the more he realized the depth of their involvement in shaping academic and technological discourse.

The Church's presence in the world of AI was not just spiritual but deeply ingrained in the very fabric of the field. This revelation added a new layer of complexity to his investigation. Dan leaned back in his chair, a mix of awe and concern etched on his face. "There's much more to the Church than meets the eye. They're not just believers; they're influencers, shapers of the future."

"But this is only circumstantial evidence, nothing concrete," Dan thought, his analytical mind seeking firmer ground. "Going to church is not a crime. Buying a Tesla isn't either. These are just guesses, pieces of a puzzle that hint at something but prove nothing definitive."

He realized that while the connections were suggestive, they were not conclusive. The real challenge lay in finding the thread that tied these elements together in a way that revealed the true story behind the incident. "I need something more tangible," Dan mused, "a piece of evidence that can't be dismissed as mere coincidence."

With this thought, he returned to his screens, his resolve renewed. The deeper layers of the mystery were still waiting to be uncovered, and Dan knew that he was the one to do it.
