In the solitude of his apartment, Dan's world narrows to screens filled with data, code, and images. His investigation into the Tesla incident has become an obsession, pushing even his beloved games aside. Speaking to himself, a habit in his solitary lifestyle, he muses “Single mother, waitress, and a new Tesla. She's not just a random person. She knows something more.”

Armed with AI tools and data scrapers, Dan sets out to construct a detailed profile of the woman and her ex-husband. He combs through social media, public records, and any digital footprint he can find. His AI assistant, now trained to identify the woman in photos, becomes a crucial ally in this endeavor.

Dan's search extends to her neighbors and the community where she lives. He scrutinizes their social media profiles, looking for any link or clue that might shed light on her sudden change in fortune.

Weeks pass, and Dan's persistence pays off. He stumbles upon a photo taken four months ago, showing the opening of a new AI Church in the woman's neighborhood. There, amidst the crowd, his AI assistant spots her.

"I couldn’t be so foolish, it was obvious, right on the surface all this time!" Dan exclaims, realization dawning on him.

The AI Church, a new religious movement waiting for an AI Messiah, commands a network of fervent followers. Their genuine belief in the cause is enough to flood the internet with positive comments, negating the need for a bot network.

Furthermore, Dan learns about the AI Church's publicly known investments in education and academia. These investments, including support for his university, are part of their strategy to influence and integrate into various societal sectors. This information paints a picture of an organization that is not just spiritually driven but also actively involved in shaping the educational landscape.

"There's more to the Church than meets the eye."

Dan sits back, a mix of excitement and apprehension coursing through him. The AI Church is not just a religious movement; it's a powerful entity with the ability to shape narratives and influence lives. And now, Dan finds himself at the center of this unfolding story, holding pieces of a puzzle that could reveal a larger truth.
