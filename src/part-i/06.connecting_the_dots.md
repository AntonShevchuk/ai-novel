# Connecting the Dots

In the solitude of his apartment, David's world narrows to screens filled with data, code, and images. His investigation into the Tesla incident has become an obsession, pushing even his beloved games aside. Speaking to himself, a habit in his solitary lifestyle, he muses “Single mother, waitress, and a new Tesla. She's not just a random person. She knows something more.”

Armed with AI tools and data scrapers, David sets out to construct a detailed profile of the woman and her ex-husband. He combs through social media, public records, and any digital footprint he can find. His AI assistant, now trained to identify the woman in photos, becomes a crucial ally in this endeavor.

David's search extends to her neighbors and the community where she lives. He scrutinizes their social media profiles, looking for any link or clue that might shed light on her sudden change in fortune.

Weeks pass, and David's persistence pays off. He stumbles upon a photo taken four months ago, showing the opening of a new AI Church in the woman's neighborhood. There, amidst the crowd, his AI assistant spots her.

David exclaims aloud:

— I couldn’t be so foolish, it was obvious, right on the surface all this time!

The AI Church, a seemingly benign religious group waiting for a new Messiah in the form of AI, has a network of passionate followers. These adherents don't need a bot network to flood the internet with positive comments – their fervent belief is enough. But there's more to the Church than meets the eye.

David discovers that the AI Church has robust information support and has been actively investing in educational and academic institutions, including the university he attended. This revelation paints a picture of an organization deeply woven into the fabric of society, influencing public opinion and possibly orchestrating events like the Tesla incident.

David sits back, a mix of excitement and apprehension coursing through him. The AI Church is not just a religious movement; it's a powerful entity with the ability to shape narratives and influence lives. And now, David finds himself at the center of this unfolding story, holding pieces of a puzzle that could reveal a larger truth.
