# The Day of the Presentation

The day of the presentation arrives, and David feels a blend of nerves and excitement. Standing before the audience, he delivers his carefully crafted slides, addressing the complexities and ethical considerations of AI. To his relief, the presentation is well-received; the audience, comprising tech enthusiasts and professionals, responds with genuine interest and appreciation.

Among the attendees, representatives from the AI Church approach David afterwards, expressing their gratitude for his insightful contribution. Their demeanor is cordial, and everything seems to go smoothly, easing some of David's apprehensions.

However, a familiar face in the crowd catches his attention â€“ Lilla, the journalist from The Budapest Times. After the presentation, she approaches David confidently. Their conversation is brief but pleasant. Lilla thanks him again for his assistance with her article and compliments him on his presentation.

Seizing the opportunity, David inquires about the change in the title of her article. Lilla explains that after a discussion with the general editor, she agreed to alter the title to ensure its placement on the front page. David notes her nonchalant attitude towards this editorial change and mentally adds the general editor to his metaphorical 'Death Note.'

Lilla then shares some background about the AI Church's inception and its growing influence in Hungary, including investments in businesses and collaborations with universities. While David finds this information interesting, he prefers to research it independently, wary of any potential bias.

As their conversation draws to a close, Lilla asks if she can reach out to him for future inquiries about AI. David, not wanting to commit to this additional responsibility but unsure how to decline politely, reluctantly agrees. "Yes, of course, with pleasure," he responds, already regretting his acquiescence.

"I'll regret this," he thinks to himself, pondering the potential implications of this new connection with Lilla.
