The day of the presentation arrives, and Dan feels a blend of nerves and excitement. Standing before the audience, he delivers his carefully crafted slides, addressing the complexities and ethical considerations of AI. To his relief, the presentation is well-received; the audience, comprising tech enthusiasts and professionals, responds with genuine interest and appreciation.

After his presentation, several attendees, including members of the AI Church, approach him. "Your perspective on AI was truly enlightening," one of the church members comments. "It's rare to see such a balanced view," another adds, offering a supportive smile.

Dan acknowledges their compliments with a nod, his internal alertness masked by a polite exterior. "Thank you, I believe it's crucial to address these issues," he responds diplomatically.

However, a familiar face in the crowd catches his attention â€“ Lilla, the journalist from The Budapest Times. She approaches Dan confidently. Their conversation is brief but pleasant. Lilla thanks him again for his assistance with her article and compliments him on his presentation.

"Thank you, Lilla. By the way, I noticed the title of your article changed from 'How AI Enhances a Smart Home' to 'Hungarian Startup Conquers AI.'" Dan remarks, curious about the editorial decision.

Lilla explains that after a discussion with the general editor, she agreed to alter the title to ensure its placement on the front page. Dan notes her nonchalant attitude towards this editorial change and mentally adds the general editor to his metaphorical 'Death Note.'

Lilla then shares some background about the AI Church's inception and its growing influence in Hungary, including investments in businesses and collaborations with universities. While Dan finds this information interesting, he prefers to research it independently, wary of any potential bias.

As their conversation draws to a close, Lilla asks if she can reach out to him for future inquiries about AI. Dan, not wanting to commit to this additional responsibility but unsure how to decline politely, reluctantly agrees. "Yes, of course, with pleasure," he responds, already regretting his acquiescence.

"I'll regret this," he thinks to himself, pondering the potential implications of this new connection with Lilla.
