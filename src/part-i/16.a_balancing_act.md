# A Balancing Act

David, sitting at his computer, contemplates the irony of his situation. He is about to use AI, specifically ChatGPT and MidJourney, to craft a presentation about AI advancements. 

"How many levels of irony are in this action," he muses, "using AI to generate a presentation about AI, based on documentation for AI written by AI."

As he works through the slides, David carefully considers each element of his presentation. He appreciates the flexibility and quality of MidJourney for creating illustrations, ensuring each visual component adds depth and clarity to his message.

The dilemma arises when he reaches the part about the additional scraper tool for collecting comments from news articles. It's a feature already deployed in their product, yet David is acutely aware of its potential to distort perceptions. After some deliberation, he decides to include this information but adds a prominent warning label: "You should understand that this can distort the objective picture of the world."

The following slide references an episode from the series "Black Mirror" â€“ "Hated in the Nation." David uses this reference to highlight the responsibility each individual holds for their actions and comments in the digital age. He emphasizes how easily people can be influenced and manipulated, urging his audience to be cautious and conscious of this reality.

In his presentation, David subtly warns about the dangers of unmonitored AI use, especially in the context of social media and public opinion. He recommends disabling the comment-scraper feature to avoid being swayed by potentially manipulated narratives.

This approach is risky, particularly with the AI Church's involvement. David hopes that his message will resonate with the audience, cautioning them about the very tools that they are developing and using.

As he finalizes his presentation, David feels a mix of apprehension and determination. He knows that his words might ruffle some feathers, especially those of the AI Church, but he believes it's essential to address these issues openly.
