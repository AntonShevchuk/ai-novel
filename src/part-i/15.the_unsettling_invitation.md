# The Unsettling Invitation

Back in the familiar environment of his office in Budapest, David attempts to immerse himself in work, hoping it would distract him from the turmoil stirred by his discovery in Vienna. However, his sense of normalcy is short-lived when his chief summons him with news that immediately sets David on edge.

“Danilov, come to my office. I have news for you.” The chief's tone is ambiguous, leaving David apprehensive as he makes his way to the office.

As he enters the office, his boss excitedly hands him a newspaper. “Look at this, Danilov! We’re on the front page!” The headline reads "Hungarian startup conquers AI," prominently featuring their company. David feels a mix of pride and irony. Despite being Ukrainian, he’s now being celebrated as part of a Hungarian success story. He decides to let this slide, focusing instead on the acknowledgment of his hard work.

The chief’s excitement doesn't end there. "We have another piece of great news. The AI Church is interested in investing in our project. They also want you to speak at their conference here in Budapest next month. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both you and our company."

David's heart rate soars. The AI Church, the very entity he's been investigating, is now entwined with his professional life. David’s stress is evident, though he tries to mask it. His chief, mistaking his anxiety for tiredness, seems oblivious to the internal turmoil he’s experiencing.

Struggling to maintain composure, David excuses himself and retreats to the restroom. "Fuck, fuck, fuck. This isn't good," he mutters under his breath, trying to calm himself. His watch indicates a dangerously high heart rate. "Breathe in, breathe out," he whispers, focusing on bringing his stress levels down.

As he manages to steady his breathing, David tries to rationalize the situation. "It's just a conference. I've spoken at these before. I can handle it." He attempts to convince himself, though the connection to the AI Church makes this task more daunting than any previous speaking engagement.

Stepping out, David realizes he’s still holding the newspaper. The article, though similar, isn’t quite the same as what Lilla, the journalist, had sent him. This discrepancy, though minor, unnerves him further, adding to the surreal nature of his current predicament.

Now, with the AI Church's conference looming, David finds himself in a precarious position. Participating as a speaker could provide him with insights and access, but it also risks entangling him deeper with an organization he knows is manipulative and secretive.

As he leaves the office that day, David knows he has a tough decision to make. Engaging with the AI Church could be a dangerous game, but it might also be his best chance to uncover more about their true intentions.
