# A Risky Call

David's suspicions about the Tesla incident deepen as he scrutinizes the video footage from various news agencies. The absence of a watermark, typically added by the police for authenticity and tracking, strikes him as highly irregular. Determined to get to the bottom of this anomaly, he decides to take a direct approach – a phone call to the Dallas road police.

He meticulously sets up his temporary phone number, purchased anonymously with cryptocurrency, ensuring his call can't be traced back to him. Using AI technology, he modifies his voice to mimic that of the Mayor of Dallas, a disguise that would lend his inquiries both urgency and authority.

David dials the number, his heart racing as the line connects. The conversation unfolds:

— Hello, it's the Mayor Johnson. Can I speak with the Chief?

— Yes, of course. I'll switch you to him - replies the officer.

— Hello, it's Mayor Johnson - David pushes the conversation forward without giving the person on the other end time to think.
— What the hell is going on? Why is your video about the Tesla incident being used by every news outlet?

There's a moment of silence on the other end of the line, and David almost ends the call, thinking he's been found out. Then, the voice returns, tinged with confusion and offense.

— But, but, but you told us to give them the video as fast as possible...

David's surprise mirrors the officer's. The revelation that the Mayor had apparently instructed the release of the footage without a watermark throws a new twist into the narrative. Thinking quickly, he covers his tracks:

— But the watermark, you forgot about the watermark. I'll get in trouble because of you.

Without waiting for a response, David ends the call abruptly.
