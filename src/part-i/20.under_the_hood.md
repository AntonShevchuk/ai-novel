# Under the Hood

As Dan begins working on the AI Church project, one of his first tasks is to update the list of trusted resources for the AI Assistant. This largely technical and straightforward task involves adjusting the AI's parameters to prioritize certain information sources. However, driven by his inquisitive nature, Dan personally explores these resources.

Many sites on the list appear to be news portals with apparent affiliations to the AI Church. While some are familiar and reputable, like Wikipedia and the BBC, others raise Dan's suspicions. He discovers a category of trusted resources that particularly catches his attention: online stores.

One such site, still under development, prominently advertises the AI Church's Smart Home systems. Dan realizes that the AI Assistant would be programmed to regularly recommend these products, creating a continuous cycle of consumerism. "Even Apple releases a new iPhone only once a year," Dan thinks. "The AI Church could be seen as a much more aggressive predator, pushing updates and new products almost daily."

Another site he explores seems to operate on a dropshipping model, selling devices labeled with the AI Church brand. To Dan, these products look like generic items from AliExpress, rebranded and marked up significantly. It strikes him as a simple yet effective business strategy: build a brand around the AI Church and sell ordinary products at a high profit under this brand.

"Genius, fucking genius," he mutters under his breath. It's a revelation â€“ the AI Church is not just a religious or ideological entity; it's a savvy business operation, capitalizing on its brand to generate substantial profits.

This discovery shifts Dan's perspective. He initially thought he was looking for hidden, nefarious activities, but instead, he finds a straightforward, albeit cunning, commercial strategy. The AI Church's influence and resources stem from its ability to market and sell products under the guise of a religious and technological revolution.
