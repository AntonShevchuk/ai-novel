# A Revelatory Visit to Vienna

For David, his second visit to Vienna, now as an adult, is a blend of the city's historical charm and his own quest for answers. Spring is blossoming in the city, adding to its allure, but David's focus is elsewhere – on the AI Church.

He locates the church, situated away from the city's popular spots but conveniently accessible by public transportation, now marked with a new stop labeled 'AI Church'. The building itself is a modern architectural marvel, inviting and grand, designed to captivate visitors.

David enters in airplane mode to avoid unnecessary digital footprints. At the reception, a friendly staff member offers him a complimentary tour of the facility, which he accepts, joining a small group of curious tourists.

Their guide is a charismatic individual, weaving tales of AI's miracles and benevolence. To David, these stories sound eerily familiar, echoing the same propaganda-like praises he's encountered in online comments. "Nothing new here," he thinks, maintaining a facade of interest.

As they walk through the building, David observes areas still under construction, with caution signs reminding visitors of the ongoing work. The tour takes a turn when the guide, after a brief conversation with a worker, leads them into the education wing of the church.

The rooms, recently vacated by students, are in disarray. David's attention, however, is not on the guide's spiel about their education programs. Instead, his gaze is drawn to a teacher's laptop left open in one of the rooms. A small paper sticker catches his eye, and he discreetly uses his phone's camera zoom to capture a photo of it.

Outside the church, David reviews the photos he has taken. His AI-enhanced phone camera has done its job well. The image is clear enough to reveal the text on the paper sticker – a login and password. Another photo shows an URL open in the browser of the laptop.

Armed with this new information, David feels a mix of triumph and apprehension. This "good catch" from a simple tour could be the key to unraveling more about the AI Church's internal workings. With these digital breadcrumbs in hand, he heads back to Budapest, ready to delve deeper into the mystery.
