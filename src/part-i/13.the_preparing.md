# The Preparing

Back in Budapest, David faces the challenge of accessing the internal site of the AI Church. His first attempt using his VPN account, useful for testing Smart Home functionalities, proves futile. The site requires access to the Church's internal network, something far beyond the reach of his current tools.

Undeterred, David contemplates his options. Accessing the Church's VPN is a near-impossible task, but what about its Wi-Fi network? During his previous visit, he hadn't checked for a public Wi-Fi connection, but he suspects the site he needs to access wouldn't be available on a public network.

The solution, he realizes, lies in cracking the Wi-Fi password to gain access to the Church's internal network. For this, he plans to use an ESP32 Marauder, a tool they use at his workplace to test the security of their Smart Home systems. David is familiar with its operation and confident in its ability to help him infiltrate the network.

However, David knows the legal and ethical risks of such an endeavor. To avoid using his personal devices, he decides to purchase a tablet solely for this operation. After some searching, he finds a Lenovo tablet at a surprisingly low price â€“ likely refurbished or stolen, he muses. Paying in cash, he ensures the transaction is untraceable.

Equipped with the ESP32 Marauder and the newly acquired tablet, David plans his second trip to Vienna. He decides to wait until the next weekend, giving him time to prepare and ensuring he won't arouse suspicion with frequent visits.

As the weekend approaches, David goes over his plan repeatedly. He understands the risks involved but also knows that this may be his only chance to access the information he seeks. With a mix of anticipation and anxiety, he readies himself for a journey that could plunge him deeper into danger.
