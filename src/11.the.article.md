# The Article

On Thursday morning, just before starting his workday, David receives a message from an unfamiliar number on WhatsApp. "Everything is ready, you can read it and give feedback," reads the message, along with a link. Initially skeptical, David almost marks the message as spam until he recognizes the name associated with the number – Lilla.

"I'll check it later," he thinks to himself, not giving it much importance as he heads to the office.

Settling into his work routine at the office, David was deep in concentration when another message from Lilla arrived, breaking his focus:

Lilla: "Did you read the article? When can you give me feedback?"

David, slightly irked at the disruption but aware of his boss’s attention, reluctantly opened the document to review the article. It was a detailed piece on smart homes and AI technology, surprisingly in-depth and technical.

After reading the article, David couldn't shake off the feeling of familiarity with the writing style. It dawned on him:

David (thinking): "It looks like it was generated by ChatGPT. A cheater, but isn't that the reality of modern journalism?"

Despite his initial reservations, David found the article well-composed and decided it would reflect positively on the company. He took a moment to correct a few minor errors and sent his feedback back to Lilla, who replied almost immediately:

Lilla: "Thank you for your time. I was very worried, as I decided to use AI for the first time to write an article about AI. I didn't know anyone else who could check this article except you. Thank you again. You can save my number; this is my personal contact. If you need help, I hope I can assist you."

David smiles at her honesty and saves her number with two labels – 'strange' and 'journalist'. The 'strange' label, a personal categorization for interesting but not closely known individuals, and 'journalist', a new addition to his contact list. Lilla, now an unexpected but potentially useful contact, represents a new connection in the world outside his immediate circle.
