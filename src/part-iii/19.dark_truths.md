# Dark Truths

Andrew arrived at the office the following Thursday, visibly troubled. He sought out Dan immediately, needing to share his latest findings.

"I confronted William about the disappearance of those people," Andrew started, his voice tinged with frustration. "But all I got was a dismissive response. He said they probably just moved somewhere else, like a park near another church."

Dan listened intently, sensing the unease in Andrew's words.

Andrew continued, "I didn't buy it, so I tried to access the camera records around the church. I thought maybe I could find something there."

"And?" Dan prompted.

"I gained access, bypassing the usual security protocols. But, Dan, all the footage from the past week, exactly from the day those people vanished, has been wiped clean. There's nothing. It's as if they never existed."

Dan listened intently, his expression growing grim. He shared with Andrew his own knowledge about William Thompson, particularly his attendance at a military exhibition, a detail not widely known or publicized. Dan's revelation seemed to hit Andrew hard; his face fell as he absorbed the news.

"William? I can't believe he's mixed up in all this."

The conversation took a somber turn as they both pondered the implications of these findings. Andrew's faith in his mentor appeared shaken, and Dan could see the conflict playing out in his friend's eyes. The man he had respected, the mentor he had trusted, was now at the center of a disturbing mystery.

Dan sympathized with Andrew's dilemma. It was a harsh awakening to realize that someone you looked up to could be involved in questionable, possibly sinister, activities. The layers of secrecy surrounding the AI Church, coupled with William's evasive behavior and the missing footage, painted a picture of an organization with much to hide.

Dan and Andrew sat in silence for a moment, each lost in their thoughts. The path ahead was fraught with unknowns and dangers.

The conversation drifted to other topics, but the shadows of the revelations lingered. As they parted ways, Dan knew that their investigation was reaching a critical point. Dan walked back to his desk, his mind racing with dark thoughts.
