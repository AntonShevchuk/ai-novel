# Revelations

Dan and Andrew met in the office rest area the following day.

Dan began the conversation by reminiscing about their shared past. "How are you doing? How long have you been in Europe?"

Andrew replied, "I'm good, thanks. I've been in Poland since 2022."

Dan empathized, "Leaving Kharkiv must have been tough for you, right?"

Andrew nodded, his expression distant. "Yes, it was chaotic. We just finished school and had to make quick decisions."

Dan related his own story. "I remember that year vividly. Finishing school amidst all that chaos was surreal. My family and I moved to Budapest, where I joined the University."

Andrew sipped his coffee, recalling, "I ended up in Warsaw with my mother. I started university there but didn't finish. Life took a different direction."

Curious, Dan asked, "What happened then?"

Andrew explained, "I had to work. I started at McDonald's, worked there for two years, and eventually became a manager."

"That's quite a shift," Dan remarked. "From McDonald's to the AI Church."

Andrew chuckled. "Yes, it sounds bizarre when you say it like that. The Church wasn’t concerned about my educational background or the lack of it. My multilingual skills – Ukrainian, Polish, English, and Russian – and my managerial experience, albeit at McDonald's, were valued."

Their conversation shifted to Andrew's role in the AI Church as they entered a meeting room. They discussed the Church's extensive investments in AI, engineering, and research, showcasing its deep integration into the tech world. Andrew detailed how the Church, with its significant Bitcoin resources, supported various initiatives, including university grants and cyber game tournaments.

Andrew did not strike Dan as a fanatic. His decision to join the AI Church was driven by practicality, rooted in the critical financial situation faced by his family.

Andrew also disclosed another aspect of his job – earning additional income in Bitcoin for social activity for AI Church.

“He really doesn’t see a problem with this, and he’s honest with me,” Dan thought, and seizing the opportunity, casually inquired, "So, if I ever need some BTC, could I buy it directly from you instead of using an ATM?"

"Sure," Andrew agreed. "I usually convert some of my BTC earnings at city ATMs. But selling directly to you would be easier."

Their shared history of fleeing Kharkiv and rebuilding their lives in foreign lands formed a subtle connection, albeit one that led them down distinctly different paths. For Dan, this meeting offered insight into an alternative reality shaped by different choices and circumstances.

As their meeting concluded, Dan reflected on the complexities surrounding Andrew. Once merely a school acquaintance, Andrew now occupied a unique position at the intersection of technology, finance, and faith within the AI Church.
