Analysis of the Article and Its Outcome

The article impacted everyone involved in gaming or working with AI, including those in the military. The game became a topic of widespread discussion, creating a significant resonance.

Lilla conducted several interviews on TV, further highlighting the issue.

The CEO of A.V.A.M. Ltd., Avraam Vin, organized a press conference to address the situation.

Avraam began with a few statements:
"This journalist has simply written what everyone already knows or could know by reading our agreement in detail. We've never hidden anything, and of course, our game remains free for everyone."

He added, "If the newspaper writes anything about you, except for an arrest or an obituary, you should know it's good for you."

When journalists attempted to ask questions, he essentially just paraphrased his initial message, offering no new information and ignoring their queries.

However, as a result of the article, 'Dark Alert' published a new agreement. Now, every player can choose how the company uses their AI model.

## 2. Result

The company also published the results, indicating that the situation was not a concern for many. Half of all players agreed that the company could use their model as they wished, even allowing usage by military companies.

Some players received new sponsorships from military companies, along with additional agreements allowing the sponsors to use the players' models as desired.

Dan reflected on these developments with a sense of disbelief, "This world is crazy. God, please burn it."

## 3. Business trip

Lilla had to leave for a business trip, preventing Dan from inviting her on a date. Consequently, Dan found himself spending time wandering, lost in his thoughts.

## 4. Work

The AI Church requested further changes, this time for specific modifications. Additionally, the new product owner expressed a desire to visit the office and meet with Dan personally.

When he arrived, Dan recognized him immediately.

It was Andrew.

## 5. Old "friend"

Andrew was from Kharkiv, a classmate whose family also fled the war.

They hadn't been able to meet on their school graduation day due to the year of the full-scale invasion.

Dan's family had escaped the war in 2022. He had moved to Budapest and started studying at the university there.

He and Andrew were never really friends; Andrew usually asked Dan for help with his homework, but there was no genuine friendship. However, it seemed Andrew thought differently about their relationship.

Long talking about Church AI and his roles in the world.
AI Church invests to much money to AI, to engeenering, to research and so on.

About salary for AI church members.
It BTC, Andrew told it is normal, AI church received to many BTC, and also pay in BTC for many activity, like helps for univercities, conferences, and also sponsor of cyber games tournament.

"Oh, it means if I need a BTC you can sold it to me for cash?" - asked Dan.
"Yes, I used to cashdraw from some BTC ATMs in the city, but of course it would be better if I sell it to you here."

## 8.

Blockchain Investigation.
Dan purchased some BTC equivalent to €200 from Andrew.
He then checked the blockchain and the history of incoming transactions in Andrew's wallet.
Andrew had received BTC from the same wallet.
Dan examined the incoming and outgoing transactions of this wallet.
The wallet had outgoing transactions to a list of 500 wallets.
Each transaction was a fixed amount, sent at the same time every month.
It appeared to be a salary to 500 "bots."

It seemed that Dan's network of AI Church bots had missed more than fifty individuals.
But this was a great detail to uncover. "Thank you, blockchain," Dan thought. "I have a significant portion of data to investigate, and I can also link wallets to user profiles."

What about the incoming transactions to the "salary wallet"?
They appeared as a mess of transactions, only their timing was regular.
Indeed, these transactions likely came from a cryptocurrency tumbler, used to mix potentially identifiable cryptocurrency funds with others, thereby obscuring the trail back to the fund's original source.

Meeting with a Council of Elders Member

Andrew requested a meeting with his chief and asked Dan to wear an AI Church T-shirt.

Some people never change.

"You should look like everyone else from our church; it's a requirement of our elders," said Andrew.

The meeting was with William Thompson.

He requested Dan to set up the AI assistant as his personal assistant, specifying several subjects and resources he wanted to analyze and follow.

William needed a setup where he could change subjects and other settings himself through the smart home interface's UI.

He inquired about how the AI works and its integration with the smart home system.

William was interested in what the AI could do with home automation and how it could be managed.

He also required options to disable and remove features as needed.

## 10. Demo for William

William requested a demonstration and decided to record it, saying, "I don't want to repeat it 25 times."

During the call, William shared his screen, revealing an unusual setup of their smart home application. He had named his home "The Order."

The setup resembled an office rather than a home, featuring a vast array of integrations, primarily networks, security cameras, and a set of climate areas and energy complexes.

To Dan, this setup seemed familiar. His company had previously dealt with unique customers, including those building bunkers, using similar setups, but William's was on a much larger scale.

The configuration displayed extensive systems for air conditioning, air generation, water filtration, plant control, and numerous other systems.

"This is our basic setup for Vault #0," William explained.

Then, William asked Dan to describe the AI in detail, focusing on suggestions and integration with the home system. He emphasized that the AI was an entirely independent system without access to the home's infrastructure, using only the internal event bus to generate reports.

William also highlighted that the AI could be easily disabled or completely removed from the UI. He detailed how he protected the system from external influences, like comments from bots.

## 11. Release on DVD

Dan received a request to release this setup.
He received from William request to release it on DVD O_o.
Really, on 25 DVDs.

He prepared it and gives to Andrew

## 12. Questions

Dan had several questions for Andrew about the elders, The Order, and the Vaults.

"I'm not a fanatic; I'm a realist. I don't believe in an AI god who will save humanity, nor do I believe in the elders who think that AI will come and kill us. These are all stupid notions," Andrew stated.

## 13. Buda Duna Pest

Dan sent a message to Lilla. She had just returned from a business trip. He walked with Lilla around the center of Budapest, discussing the AI Church.

Dan decided to join AI Church to understand what it is doing.

# 14.

New meeting with Andrew.
Andrew is happy to hear that Dan wants to join AI Church.
Andrew will receive a hiring bonus for Dan as AI Engineer.
Andrew told Dan, that AI Church has an internal dashboard with all positions, and AI specialists it is a crucial position with high bonus for hiring.

Dan told, that he doesn't want to leave his company, and ready only for remote part-time work day. Andrew looks sad about this. But he is continuing his speech:

"Yes, it is possible, but I'm sure you will want to switch to full-time, because we provide the best salary and bonuses ever you meet in Europe."

# 15. First working day

Andrew did the trick, AI Church made agreement with Dan's company, and now, Dan's time in fact was sold to AI Church like a out-staffing.

The Order

The Order of the Resistance is a highly secretive organization within the AI Church.

The Order is preparing for resistance against a new reality, believing that AI intends to enslave or destroy humanity.

The Order of the Resistance aims to be ready for this eventuality, striving to preserve both human habitats and the maximum diversity of the human species.

Being prepared doesn't mean halting AI development at its inception; this is deemed impossible in the future, as people who are unaware of the risks will continue to create artificial intelligence. The goal is to minimize losses, which could range from thousands to potentially billions of lives.

The Order's intention is to initiate a war with AI, to demonstrate the dangers of this technology to humanity. However, they also believe in advancing this technology to the required level for such a confrontation.

The goals of The Order include:

- Assisting in the improvement of AI.
- Integrating AI into military applications.
- Initiating a war between AI and humanity.
- Constructing 25 vaults to safeguard humanity and all knowledge.

Establishing a military faction, commanded by an individual known as Ifrit.


# 23. Message to newspapers

Scheduled massage from Andrew to favorite lists of newspapers.

# 24. Result of article

Arrests of accounts, some guys also arrested. The FBI and CIA also join the investigation.
And so-and-so on. Ifrit and his mercenaries are disappeared.

But in fact, AI Church still exists, but without many followers and money from investors.
They changed a format from "AI is our God", to "AI is our enemy".

New main direction — create the set of rules for AI. Included military sector.
New doctrine for new time.
