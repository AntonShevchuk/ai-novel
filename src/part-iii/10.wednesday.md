# Wednesday

The day of the meeting dawned, and half an hour prior to the scheduled 12 PM start, Andrew sent Danya an appointment reminder. He arrived with a selection of AI Church T-shirts in various sizes and a hefty pack of other merchandise.

Danya couldn't help but comment as he sifted through the items, "This feels like a welcome kit to the AI Church."

"You might say that," Andrew replied with a cryptic smile. "I think it'll all make sense to you soon enough."

After trying on a few sizes, Danya settled on the best-fitting T-shirt and changed into it. He and Andrew then made their way to the meeting room. To Danya's surprise, the room was empty, save for them and a few virtual attendees from the AI Church on the screen.

"Hi, everyone. Seems like we're all here. Let's get this discussion started," announced a familiar voice from the virtual gathering. Danya immediately recognized the speaker.

It was William Thompson, a name previously entangled in Danya's investigation of The Dark Alert game but conspicuously absent from Lilla's article.

William's request was straightforward yet intricate. He sought Danya's expertise in setting up the AI assistant as his personal assistant. He detailed the specific subjects and resources he wanted the AI to monitor and follow.

The customization William desired was extensive. He needed a setup that allowed him to alter subjects and various settings independently through a smart home interface's UI. His questions delved into the AI's functionalities, its integration with the smart home system, and its capabilities in managing home automation. He emphasized the need for options to disable and remove features as necessary.

William expressed the need for a Proof of Concept (POC) for these functionalities.

"I'll need another meeting for a demo once you have the POC ready. I don't want to have to explain this 25 times over," William stated, already planning ahead.

"I'll arrange it," Andrew quickly responded, taking note of William's request.

"Thanks for your time, guys. Looking forward to seeing some great results soon," William concluded, ending the call abruptly before Danya and Andrew could even utter a goodbye.

Left in the silence of the meeting room, Danya and Andrew exchanged glances, both understanding the magnitude of the task ahead.

"I guess we have our work cut out for us," Danya muttered, still processing the whirlwind of events and the unexpected turn his day had taken.
