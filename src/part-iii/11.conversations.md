# Conversations

Over the weeks, while working on the proof of concept and its accompanying UI, Danya and Andrew spent considerable time together. Their shared office space led to various conversations about their past in Kharkiv and the aftermath of the war. Both felt nostalgic for their city, yet acknowledged the opportunities and knowledge they had gained in Europe. They believed their experiences would one day allow them to return home and contribute meaningfully.

In between work discussions, Danya's curiosity about the AI Church's inner workings grew. He asked Andrew, "Who are these Elders you mention? What exactly do you know about them?"

Andrew shrugged, "I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. They're like the top brass of the AI Church. But who's at the very top, or what their ultimate goal is, remains a mystery to me."

Danya probed further, "And how many of them are there?"

"There are twenty-five Elders," Andrew replied.

"But who's your direct boss? All of them, or could it be one of the Elders?"

"Yes, William is my boss. He's been mentoring me since I joined the Church."

As they continued their conversation, Andrew expressed his pragmatic approach to his involvement with the AI Church. "I'm no fanatic. I donâ€™t buy into the whole AI deity narrative or the Elders' fears that AI might turn against us. It's all quite far-fetched."

Danya raised his eyebrows, "So, you're saying the Elders aren't proponents of AI?"

"No, they are, in a way. They're gearing up for a future where they believe humanity might have to confront AI. Sounds like science fiction, right? William keeps trying to sell me on the idea, but I just can't take it seriously."

Danya nodded, absorbing Andrew's perspective. "It does sound bizarre," he said.

As they wrapped up their conversation, Danya reflected on the complex web of beliefs and motivations within the AI Church. The concept of a war against AI seemed like a distant, unreal scenario, yet it was one that the Elders apparently took very seriously.
