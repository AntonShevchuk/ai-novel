# Surprises

After the meeting, Dan felt a mix of curiosity and skepticism that prompted him to explore a nagging hypothesis. He navigated to the AI Church database, a comprehensive resource he had compiled over months of investigation. It didn’t take long for him to find Andrew’s profile among the many entries.

“Surprise, surprise,” Dan mused to himself.

With a blend of curiosity and apprehension, he decided to delve deeper into Andrew's recent life. He accessed Andrew’s social media profiles, scrolling through Instagram and Facebook. Each post and comment added layers to the unfolding narrative of Andrew's life post-Kharkiv.

The comments Andrew made on posts related to the AI Church were particularly revealing. They were not the words of a casual follower, but of someone deeply embedded in the Church's philosophy and activities.

“Et tu, Brute?” Dan whispered.

'Ah, Andrew, what have you gotten yourself into?' Dan thought, shaking his head. This was more than just a new-age religion flirtation; it was a deep dive into something much deeper, and potentially more dangerous. He remembered Andrew's past involvement in a multi-level marketing scheme like Amway, but this was entirely different.

Leaning back in his chair, Dan felt a sense of déjà vu. Andrew, once just a schoolmate seeking homework help, was now deeply involved in a complex and potentially perilous situation. The irony of finding a connection to his past within the AI Church wasn't lost on Dan.

As he sifted through photos of Andrew’s recent life, Dan pondered what had drawn Andrew to the AI Church. What role did he play? How deep was his involvement? And most importantly, what did this mean for Dan's own investigation into the AI Church’s activities? This discovery added a new, personal dimension to the puzzle he was assembling.
