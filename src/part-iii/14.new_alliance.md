# New Alliance

Danya's next meeting with Andrew unveiled unexpected opportunities. The air was tinged with a mix of anticipation and apprehension as they sat down to discuss Danya's potential involvement with the AI Church.

Andrew's demeanor radiated excitement upon hearing that Danya was considering joining the Church. "That's fantastic news, Danya! Your expertise as an AI Engineer will be invaluable to us. And you should know, the Church offers a hiring bonus for bringing in specialists like you."

Danya listened intently as Andrew delved into the details. "We have an internal dashboard listing all open positions. AI specialists are in high demand, commanding significant hiring bonuses."

Danya, however, was quick to clarify his stance. "I appreciate the offer, Andrew, but I'm not looking to leave my current job. I could consider remote, part-time work, though."

Andrew's expression briefly clouded with disappointment, but he quickly recovered. "That's certainly an option, Danya. But I have to say, you might find our full-time offers very tempting. The AI Church is known for offering some of the most competitive salaries and bonuses in Europe."

Danya weighed Andrew's words carefully, sensing the underlying urgency in his pitch. The offer was attractive, but he was aware of the deeper implications of such a commitment. Joining the AI Church, even on a part-time basis, would mark a significant shift in his career and potentially his personal beliefs.

As the meeting drew to a close, Danya realized that this decision was more than just a career move; it was a step into a world where the lines between technology, faith, and ethics were increasingly blurred. The offer lingered in his mind as he left the meeting, pondering the path that lay ahead.
