# Deepening Mysteries

The progression of Andrew's career within the AI Church was not lost on Dan. Andrew's ascent to a Senior Project Manager role spoke volumes about his capabilities and the trust the Church placed in him. The regular biweekly visits to Dan's office in Budapest had become a norm, and during these visits, their conversations often drifted towards the enigmatic aspects of the AI Church.

On one such visit, as they sat in the dimly lit corner of the office cafeteria, Dan decided to delve deeper into the mysteries of "The Order" and the "Vaults." He sensed that Andrew, with his newfound position and influence, might hold more pieces to this perplexing puzzle.

Andrew, seemingly at ease with his elevated status, obliged Dan's curiosity. "The Order, you see, is essentially our Council of Elders. They're the ones who believe in and prepare for the possibility of an AI-led war. Their influence runs deep within the Church," Andrew began, his tone matter-of-fact.

He continued, "The Vaults are a part of their grand plan. They've constructed 25 of these around the world, each designed to house a thousand people. But these aren't just shelters; they're more like fortresses, meant to protect the Church's most dedicated members and sponsors in case of a conflict with AI."

Dan listened intently, his analytical mind dissecting each word. The concept of building vaults for an anticipated war against AI was as fascinating as it was surreal. The stark reality of such preparation painted a picture of an organization not only steeped in belief but also in action.

The hefty price of admission to these vaults, a whopping started from 10 BTC per person, was another aspect that piqued Dan's interest. It was a clear indication of the Church's significant financial resources.

As Andrew elaborated on the operational intricacies of the Vaults and the strategic vision of The Order, Dan's mind swirled with thoughts. The more he learned, the more complex and profound the workings of the AI Church appeared. This was no ordinary religious group; it was an entity with deep roots and far-reaching ambitions.

Each revelation brought new questions, adding layers to the already intricate tapestry of the AI Church's story. Dan realized that understanding the full scope of the Church's activities and intentions was going to be a challenge, one that he was increasingly eager to undertake.

As their meeting concluded, Dan felt a mix of apprehension and intrigue. The puzzle was becoming more elaborate, and Dan knew he was only scratching the surface. The journey ahead promised to be filled with revelations and challenges, and he was ready to face them head-on.
