# Tracing the Trail

Despite his reservations and unanswered questions, Dan pressed on with his investigation. He embarked on a meticulous task: tracing the Bitcoin wallets linked to the Church's network. It was a puzzle that beckoned to be solved, and he couldn't resist the challenge. His approach was methodical and calculated.

First, he created and set up an overwatch tool, a sophisticated system designed to monitor and track the output transactions from the targeted Bitcoin wallets. This tool would be the linchpin in unraveling the complex web of financial transactions.

Next, Dan turned his attention to identifying specific transactions. His goal was to link each transaction to an individual within the Church's network. This was no easy feat, given the anonymity typically associated with Bitcoin transactions. However, Dan had an edge â€“ his extensive database of the Church's members, replete with their geolocations.

Dan's strategy involved cross-referencing the transaction data with the geolocations of individuals in his database. Many members of the Church, as he discovered, had unwittingly provided clues through their social media activities. They had shared photos of their surroundings, some as innocuous as neighborhood landmarks, others more revealing with identifiable features near their homes.

Utilizing Google Street View, Dan meticulously matched these images with real-world locations. For some individuals, he could only pinpoint their district; for others, he was able to narrow it down to specific houses or streets. This painstaking process enabled him to establish a geographical context for many of the transactions, a crucial step in linking the Bitcoin wallets to real people.

Yet, amid this web of complexities, Dan remained focused. The task was arduous, but the potential insights it promised were too compelling to ignore. For Dan, this wasn't just about tracing Bitcoin transactions; it was about uncovering the layers of a mystery that had consumed his life for months.
