# The Demo

Two weeks after their intense preparations, Andrew scheduled a meeting between Dan and William. The anticipation was palpable as Dan geared up for the demonstration.

Once the call commenced, William took the lead, sharing his screen to unveil the intricacies of his smart home setup, aptly named "The Order." The interface on display was unlike any typical household setup; it was more akin to an advanced command center.

The layout was meticulously organized, encompassing an extensive range of integrations that went beyond standard home automation. Networks, security cameras, climate control areas, and energy complexes were all part of this elaborate system. To Dan, it was reminiscent of setups used in high-security facilities, something he had encountered in past projects involving bunker construction. However, William's setup was far more comprehensive, suggesting a scale and complexity that was both impressive and slightly unnerving.

William guided them through various aspects of the system, pointing out the sophisticated air conditioning, air generation, water filtration, and plant control mechanisms. "This," he said, "is the standard configuration for what we call Vault #0."

"Yes, he's just bragging," Dan thought.

As the demo progressed, William's focus shifted to the AI assistant. He asked Dan to delve into the AI's capabilities, particularly its ability to integrate with and make suggestions for the smart home system.

Dan answered and stressed the AI's independence, clarifying that it had no direct access to the home's infrastructure but relied solely on the gathered data before generating reports.

"The AI can be fully controlled, disabled, or even removed from the system," Dan elaborated, demonstrating the user interface's flexibility. He also explained his security measures, particularly against external manipulations like bot-generated comments.

At the conclusion of the meeting, William made an unexpected request â€“ the release of this elaborate setup on DVDs. The request took Dan aback. In a world where cloud storage and digital downloads were the norms, this request for physical DVDs seemed archaic.

After this, William just disconnected. He again didn't wait for anyone and didn't follow the informal protocol of online communication.

"Demo just finished," said Andrew. "And all looks good, as far as I can see."

"Does he always do this?" asked Dan.

"Yep."

Nevertheless, Dan accepted the challenge. He scoured for a DVD writer and blank discs, eventually gathering an assortment of DVDs from various brands. The task of burning 25 DVDs was daunting, but he managed to complete it, handing over the final product to Andrew.

As he watched Andrew leave with the DVDs, Dan couldn't help but wonder about the rationale behind such an unusual request. The world of AI Church was proving to be a labyrinth of surprises and mysteries.

I made minor grammar and wording improvements for clarity and flow.
