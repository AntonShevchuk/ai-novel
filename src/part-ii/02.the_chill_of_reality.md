# The Chill of Reality

David, battling the chilly winds of Budapest's fall season, finds solace only in the warmth of his hot coffee. The office's budget-friendly coffee never appealed to him, pushing him to frequent local coffee shops for that perfect brew. On one such day, while transitioning from the coffee shop to his office, a headline from The Budapest Times catches his eye. Compelled by an inexplicable urge, he buys the newspaper, a break from his usual routine.

Back at the office, he scrutinizes the newspaper, curious about his spontaneous purchase. The headline "AI in Military Service" stands out, piquing his interest.

"Interesting," David murmurs, delving into the article.

It details the integration of AI in military applications, focusing on Israel's pioneering efforts in autonomous defense systems. The article elaborates on fully autonomous gun towers and drone destruction systems deployed by the Israeli army. For David, who's well-versed in AI advancements through his daily reports, the article offers a comprehensive analysis of trends he's already familiar with. It underscores a significant shift in global military strategy, marking the dawn of a new era where AI takes a central role in warfare.

Glancing at the author's name, David's lips curve into a smile - it's Lilla. Her byline brings back memories of their previous encounters and the investigation they had delved into together.

However, despite the familiarity and a sense of camaraderie he once shared with Lilla, David hesitates. The fear of reaching out to her again, without a substantial reason, holds him back. The memory of their last meeting, the tension, and her fears about continuing the investigation linger in his mind.

David's fingers hover over his phone, contemplating whether to send her a message. The urge to reconnect, to share his thoughts on her latest piece, battles with his apprehension about reopening a chapter that had seemingly closed.
