# A Quiet Christmas

December ushers in a festive atmosphere in the office, with decorations adding a cozy charm to the workspace. Despite the holiday spirit that fills the air, David feels a tinge of loneliness. This year, he faces the prospect of celebrating Christmas alone in Budapest, far from his family in Ukraine.

The ongoing restrictions on civilian air travel to Ukraine mean that a journey home is not feasible. Considering the alternative – a grueling two-day train journey each way – David reluctantly decides against traveling. The reality of not having enough vacation days to accommodate such a trip cements his decision to stay put for the holidays.

To make the best of the situation, David decides to treat himself. He purchases a bottle of local dry wine, imagining the warmth it will bring on the cold winter nights. Along with the wine, he indulges in a new game, a gift to himself to fill the quiet hours.

In a bid to fully disconnect and immerse himself in the festive season, David makes another deliberate choice – to mute his AI assistant. It's a conscious decision to step away from the constant flow of information, the ongoing investigation, and the complexities of his work. For a few days, at least, he yearns to lose himself in the simplicity of the holidays, the new game, and the quiet comfort of his own company.

The twinkling Christmas lights around the city and the festive cheer offer a bittersweet solace. As David sits in his apartment, sipping wine and delving into his new game, he reflects on the year gone by – the challenges, the discoveries, and the solitary journey he's embarked on. It's a time for rest, but also a time for introspection, as he braces for the unknowns that the new year might bring.
