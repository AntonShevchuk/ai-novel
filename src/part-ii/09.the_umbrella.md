# The Umbrella

David's foray into the world of 'The Dark Alert' reveals a peculiar facet of the game: the AI models and their data are stored client-side, accessible for inspection and potential modification by players. To participate in official tournaments or online play, these models need to be uploaded to the game server for a stringent validation process. The size of these models is substantial, ranging from a hefty 40 to 100 GB.

Curiosity piqued, David downloads the game, intending to delve into its files and mechanics. As he navigates through the game's directory, he encounters a lengthy and daunting agreement file. Rather than wade through the legalese himself, he cleverly decides to send it to ChatGPT for a concise summary.

The essence of the agreement is straightforward yet binding: "We are not responsible for any changes made to the AI models; we reserve the right to reject your model; any modifications and the models themselves become our property."

This clause prompts David to question the ownership of the AI models' intellectual property, both before and after any player-made modifications. The response from ChatGPT clarifies: "The AI models, irrespective of their state, are the intellectual property of the Umbrella Group."

Intrigued, David delves deeper into the document, seeking explicit confirmation of this claim. There, written in legal jargon, he finds the statement: "AI models of all gamers are the intellectual property of the Umbrella Group." Further searches within the document reveal that this 'Umbrella Group' is not the game's developer or owner. It's an entirely separate entity, mentioned only in this specific context.



For a fleeting moment, David humorously entertains the thought that this could be a reference to the notorious 'Umbrella Corporation' from Capcom's games. But he quickly dismisses this as fanciful thinking â€“ sometimes, an umbrella is just an umbrella.

Determined to uncover more about this mysterious "Group," David embarks on a digital expedition. He combs through LinkedIn profiles, scrutinizes information from former employees, and even pinpoints the company's address in Cyprus.

Intrigued and seeking more information about this elusive entity, David employs Google Street View to examine the Cyprus address associated with the Umbrella Group. The result is anticlimactic: an unremarkable office building, giving away no secrets of the organization it houses.

The profiles related to the 'Umbrella Group' are enigmatic, almost ghostlike in their online presence. They offer only the barest details, accompanied by a single photograph each. Nothing substantial emerges from these digital shadows.

Frustrated by the lack of progress but undeterred, David archives the information and images he's gathered. He writes a script to continuously monitor these profiles for any changes, setting up alerts to notify him of any updates. Despite reaching a dead end, David's investigation into the 'Umbrella Group' has added another layer of mystery to his ongoing exploration of the AI-driven world around him.
