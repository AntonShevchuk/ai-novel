# Unveiling the Shadows

On a typical Wednesday morning, David's routine is interrupted by a concise message from Lilla: "Tomorrow, 10:00." His reply is equally brief, a simple acknowledgment. The meeting means requesting time off, a thought that fills him with slight apprehension about explaining it to his boss.

Arriving at the café the next day, David spots Lilla already there, coffee in hand. He braces for potential disappointment but is instead met with a surprising revelation.

Without preamble, Lilla dives into her findings. "I've done some digging into those two individuals you were curious about. I asked some all-knows-guys, and they told me about one of them. This one, going by the name 'Jeremy Badi' or 'Jeremy Junior', is quite an interesting figure. He's a legitimate arms dealer, involved in official dealings with military companies and various governments. Prefers to deal in crypto, though," she explains.

Intrigued, David leans in. "All-knows-guys?" he inquires, curious about her sources.

Lilla smiles. "Being a journalist has its perks. I've got contacts in diverse places, including law enforcement and... let's say, less conventional sources."

"That's quite revealing. But what's our next move with this information?" David asks, pondering the implications.

"We need to stick to what we can publicly verify. Insider knowledge is off-limits. We're looking for public connections, open links between these individuals," Lilla suggests.

"Like OSINT?" David queries, thinking of open-source intelligence methods.

"Exactly. That's our way forward," confirms Lilla.

They spend the next hour discussing various OSINT techniques and their effectiveness, particularly reflecting on their use in the recently concluded Ukraine-Russia war. David listens intently, realizing that these strategies might just help them untangle the complex web they've stumbled upon.
