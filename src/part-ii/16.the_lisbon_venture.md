# The Lisbon Venture

Lisbon greeted David with its vibrant charm, a welcome change from the cold Budapest winter. February in Lisbon brought a mix of fresh sea breezes and the lively buzz of a city thriving in technology and innovation.

Davidâ€™s mission, however, was far from a leisurely excursion. He had meticulously planned to track down the elusive individuals at an AI conference. It was a task that made him feel more like a field spy than a software developer.

Before embarking on this unusual venture, David had approached his boss with the idea of attending an AI conference in Lisbon. The chief, recognizing the potential benefits for the company, readily agreed and offered to cover the expenses.

The conference was a bustling hub of AI enthusiasts, experts, and researchers. David navigated through the crowd, scanning faces, and engaging in conversations, all the while keeping an eye out for the individuals he was tracking. Despite his vigilance, the targets of his search were nowhere to be found.

Instead, David found himself repeatedly crossing paths with members of the AI Church. They were easy to spot, their enthusiasm for AI almost rivaling religious fervor. He observed their interactions, noting the blend of technological jargon with a near-spiritual reverence for AI. It was an intriguing mix, but not the lead he was hoping for.

As the conference came to a close, David felt a mix of frustration and relief. While he hadn't achieved his primary goal, the experience offered him a broader perspective on the AI community and the diverse array of individuals it attracted. He returned to Budapest with new insights but no closer to unraveling the mystery.
