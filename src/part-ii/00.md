# Part II. Prompts.

## The hated project

It was a very warm and adventurous summer.
But it ended. Reality is here, and it's not a fairy tale.

The dedicated project for Church AI was finished.
The customer asked him to implement a monitoring system for statistical reports about active users and clicks on the links from the report. Of course, they wanted to check the conversion rate. Just like any shop.

A church that sells faith. And Dan is part of this business.

## Investigation continues

He didn't stop the investigation; his AI Assistant continued to work.
Dan occasionally checks the database of bots, but it seems to have found all possible profiles - 448 profiles, with only 4 new ones in the last month. As he understood, these were real people, fanatics of the AI church. He also used photos of these people from their public profiles to train the AI to detect them.
Dan checked this; the AI had 99% accuracy.
He found that some people had links to others in their public social profiles.

So, Dan had an AI that could detect people from a list in photos. But he didn't understand where to search next, or what he wanted to find.

## The wind of change
After the summer, fall came with its winds and cold.

Dan didn't like the cold winds in Budapest. Only hot coffee could make him feel better.
But coffee in the office stole from the "budget", which he didn't like.
One workday, while walking between the coffee shop and work, he noticed the familiar newspaper headline - The Budapest Times. For some unknown reason, he decided to buy this issue of the newspaper, and with this unexpected purchase, he returned to the office.

"Oh, what's the reason," thought Dan as he looked at the newspaper more closely - the subtitle read "AI in military service."

"Interesting," Dan began reading.

The article was about new technologies, and how military companies started using AI for enemy recognition on the battlefield. It talked about the first fully autonomous tower with a machine gun built and used by Israel. How the Israeli army used a fully autonomous system to destroy drones at the border. It was a good analysis of information, which Dan already knew from his daily report. It seemed like a new era, very important changes for all armies in the world - all of them trying to integrate AI into their systems for handling battles.

Dan noticed the author, and yes, it was Lilla. He smiled.

But he was afraid to write to her again and meet her, without any reason.

## Winter is coming.

The days dragged on in a work routine
coding, testing, publishing,
and again and again.
It seemed like some kind of Groundhog Day, only the weather was getting worse every day.
First frost.
Winter is coming.

## The Side Effect.

Routine days continued into December.
The routine of usual days was interrupted.

Dan received a very strange result in his daily report: an unpopular game received mentions in every report for a week. Why was it so strange? Usually, before new releases of any game, he saw the same situation. But this was not a new game, not a famous game, not a widespread game. It was not a new version of Stalker.

He improved his AI Assistant, and now it had a debug mode for analyzing report results, and now Dan could easily understand why he received some results in the report.

He ran the debug mode and received very interesting data.
He thought, the AI Assistant used every subject for analysis as an independent set of data, but not. The AI Assistant, because it knew every subject, used the entire set of data, and as a result, every investigation's subject had an effect on each other's investigation subject.

"Mmmm, not good, not terrible," - it was a citation from the mini-series about Chernobyl.

This was not good, it looked like a bug, but otherwise, the report was really good, and it really fit the user's expectations. Okay, I will keep this in mind, but don't want to change this behavior.

So, Dan answered himself for the question of why he read so many times about this game - for now, he had two active subjects - Games and AI, and this game was mentioned in the news about Games and about AI.

Strange, it looked like somebody spent too much money on advertisement and promotion. Dan decided to look at this game closer.

## The Dark Alert.

A.V.A.M. Ltd. - Aut vincere, aut mori.

The game was titled The Dark Alert from new A.V.A.M. Ltd.
It sounded like trying to use the Red Alert title as a referral, and the same vibe from this old game in the video trailers.

This new game looked like just another first-person shooter. The authors of the game used the theme of the war between Ukraine and Russia, thinking they would achieve success. In the game, you could choose one of two commands: UA (Ukrainian Alliance) or RU (Red Union).

Dan noticed a good word game - UA - it was the ISO code for Ukraine, and also the Ukrainian Alliance in the game. RU - was also the ISO for Russia, and the Red Union in the game.

But the authors missed one point - nobody wants to play on the losing side.

Dan knew some guys at his work also played this game, and everyone chose the Ukraine side. Yes, Hungarian citizens remember what evil the Soviet Union did in their country, and what was the Russian Federation before collapse, which in fact was the successor to the Soviet Union.

Dan delved into the world of this game; it was just a free-to-play shooter with an in-game shop for buying skins for weapons, characters, and so on.
In this game, you could find many military vehicles, and also the possibility for simple modernization of them, like camouflage nets or other options.
And also possible to build some simple constructions like trenches and dugouts, "Fortnite for adult boys," Dan noticed.

Many times the authors of the game tried to attract attention to the game. But without any major effect. The game was still unbalanced. Too many gamers wanted to play on the Ukrainian side, and not for the Russians. As a result, they faced a situation where the game didn't start because the Ukrainian team was full, but the Russian side wasn't filled to the needed level of members.

Next, they tried to restart the game - additional technical bonuses for the Russian side, which should fix the game balance. There were artillery strikes and air strikes, and other options, but it also was not enough to fix the game balance.

And right now, it was like a new attempt. To bring balance back to the game, the authors of the game added a new feature. Everything remained the same for the UA side, but for their opponent RU, the authors of the game added a new feature - the gamer received a unit with 4 troops, and the gamer received basic controls for them, it worked very similarly to the real world, the player just gave orders by voice to the microphone.

It was a really interesting feature, it really looked like something new in the game world. The authors promised that bots didn't use server data for decision-making, just used their AI to analyze the situation and decide what to do next.

## The advertising works

Dan didn't like shooters, and of course, he didn't want to play on the RU side. He decided just to watch the gameplay on YouTube and Twitch services.

This should be enough to satisfy his curiosity.

He saw that this game really had good feedback from real players. And the AI of units had good progress from release to release.

But he saw the players use this new feature unlike how the authors of the game had intended. Players inside the RU team started fighting each other. It looked like a Battle Royale from other games, but inside one team.
It was possible because troops in a unit didn't know anything about another unit. Like in the real world, you as a commander should know the situation and have communication with other commanders. But as a result - it was not team play. Commanders fought each other and used radio just to joke with each other. And after this, whoever won tried to fight the UA team. It was strange but gave many players fun.

"It looks like the real Russian army, where every field commander wants to receive all awards alone," thought Dan, who watched these videos.

But this was not what interested him. Dan noticed how the AI worked in this game. He noticed that every trooper in your unit had individual AI, and he didn't have an unseen link to another trooper in the unit. So, as a result, friendly fire was possible not only between units but also inside troopers in a unit. So it looked interesting. The AI worked independently and tried to analyze the situation itself. And if it thought it saw an enemy, it tried to kill him.

## Working bored

From the beginning of December in the office space, there was a feeling of celebration.
It was very cozy.

Dan liked Christmas holidays, but this was the first time he celebrated them alone.
He couldn't travel to his hometown in Ukraine because the airlines still didn't work for civilians. Trains to his hometown - it was 2 days on the road in one direction. This was too much; he didn't have enough vacation days for this. As a fact, he decided to spend the holidays in Budapest.

He bought local dry wine and a new game as presents for himself.
And yes, he muted the AI assistant again.

## The Rules Changed

Several weeks later, he returned to AI reports and noticed that "Dark Alert," the game, had returned to prominence in the AI reports, with an abundance of news about it.

The game designers had adapted to user feedback, significantly altering the game. It now resembled a competition between a coach and their AI bots. The developers had introduced a feature allowing gamers to train their own models for the game. As a result, the game evolved into competitions between coaches, their AI units, and the computational power of their machines.

This game drew attention from hardware developers like Nvidia and AMD. These companies started recognizing skilled players and awarding them with the latest hardware, enhancing their gameplay experience.

The game's popularity soared, appealing both to avid gamers and team players. It transformed into a 5 vs 5 format, featuring real players in one team against a single player and their four bots in the opposing team. It was reminiscent of "Counter-Strike," but with a modern twist, incorporating vehicles, droids, copters, and other elements seen in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Dan began to watch streams of the game again. The progress over a month was astonishing. It seemed as though the development team had worked tirelessly through the Christmas holidays.

## The Umbrella

A notable aspect of the game was that the model and all data were client-side, allowing anyone to inspect and potentially modify it. However, to participate in tournaments or even play online, players had to upload their model to the server for validation. These models were large, ranging from 40 to 100 GB.

Intrigued, Dan decided to download the game and explore its files. He stumbled upon a lengthy agreement file. Not wanting to read it in its entirety, he sent it to ChatGPT, asking for a brief analysis.

The gist of the agreement was: "We are not responsible for any changes made; we reserve the right to reject your model; any modifications and models become our property."

Dan found this boring but necessary to understand. He inquired, "Who owns the intellectual property rights of these models before and after modifications?"

The reply was clear: "AI models, both before and after modifications, are the intellectual property of the Umbrella Group."

Seeking confirmation, Dan asked for a specific citation from the agreement. It stated: "AI models of all gamers are the intellectual property of the Umbrella Group."

Upon searching for "Umbrella" in the document, Dan indeed found this clause. However, the 'Umbrella Group' was not the game's owner or developer. It was a unique entity only mentioned in this context.

Dan humorously thought it might be "Umbrella Corporation," a nod to Capcom's creation, but dismissed the idea. Sometimes an umbrella is just an umbrella.

Attempting to learn more about this "Group," Dan explored several LinkedIn profiles and former employee information. He even located the company's address in Cyprus, but it was just an unremarkable office building.

These profiles were shadowy, with minimal online presence and no significant digital footprints. They contained only basic information and a single photo.

Unable to find more through AI Church's people-network, Dan hit a dead end. He saved the information and photos, and wrote a script to monitor profile changes, setting up notifications for any updates.

## Reddit

Perplexed by the elusive "Umbrella Group," Dan's searches kept leading back to the fictional "Umbrella Corporation" from the Resident Evil games.

Deciding to leverage the power of the Reddit community, he created a new account under the pseudonym "ProfessorFromUmbrella." Joining a subreddit dedicated to "Dark Alert," he posted: "Who is the Umbrella Group?"

He included descriptions and excerpts from the agreement, seeking anyone with knowledge about the Group. Choosing a Friday evening (PTS time) for maximum engagement, he received a flood of comments. Unfortunately, despite the community's efforts, including LinkedIn screenshots and other searches, nothing new was uncovered.

## Top ten

This Reddit post created quite a stir. Dan posted it during the Friday "office prime time" in the USA, which was 00:00 in Budapest. He spent two hours reading comments before going to sleep.

On Saturday, he started with the AI report, focusing on his favorite topic: Game and AI. Interestingly, he found several news pieces related to his Umbrella Group post.

"It seems like I've altered reality," he thought, amused.

The comments ranged from "this is very strange" to humorous trolling about reptilians and impending doom. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of responses, Dan found it amusing but unfruitful.

However, the next AI report on Sunday brought an interesting development. The company owning Dark Alert issued a press release stating, "We apologize; our agreement was outdated, originating from an old outsourcing provider. It was a mistake. All models are the property of A.V.A.M. Ltd."

Dan found this response dubious. "Really? This new game version was released only three months ago, and now they're changing providers? Very strange."

## Circles on the Water

A week later, the Reddit topic continued to attract comments, but interest in the agreement had waned. 

Dan received multiple notifications from his monitoring tools indicating profile changes in the Umbrella team on LinkedIn.

Upon checking, he noticed all Umbrella-related information had been removed from their profiles. "It seems they were real people, and someone ordered them to clean up their profiles," Dan concluded, having saved all their information and contacts previously.

Dan knew it was normal on LinkedIn to have numerous connections, many of whom you might not know personally. He wrote a Python script to monitor changes in these connections and soon hit pay dirt.

Two profiles vanished from the Umbrella contacts. "This is intriguing," he thought.

## Deep into Investigation

Two individuals, two active profiles, but no apparent connection between them. Both were self-employed, each owning a blockchain startup. They had attended the same AI conferences, yet there were no photos of them together.

"A good hypothesis," Dan mused. He ran a script to analyze their conference attendance and found a pattern. Over the past year, they had consistently attended the same events, focusing on blockchain, AI, and military topics.

Dan pieced together the circumstantial evidence:

Game development company A.V.A.M. Ltd. used a third-party copyright agreement, but the actual owners were unknown.
Members of the Umbrella Group, both current and former employees, removed all mentions of the company from their public profiles, seemingly on someone's orders.
Concurrently, two individuals disconnected their LinkedIn profiles from Umbrella Group employees.

These two individuals attended the same conferences at the same times but had no direct evidence of knowing each other.
Additionally, both had been present at military exhibitions in the past month.

"Sounds like a conspiracy theory. Maybe I should buy a foil hat," Dan joked to himself.

## The meeting is not a date

Unsure of what to do next, Dan decided to message Lilla.

"Hi, it's been a while. If you're free, could we meet? P.S. It's not a date ;)"

She responded quickly:

"Hi )) Let's meet on Saturday at our usual spot at 12:00."

Dan arrived early at the café and ordered coffee, expecting Lilla to be late. However, to his surprise, she arrived just as the waiter took Dan's order.

"Please, I'll have the same," said Lilla, sitting down.

"I'm guessing you have an interesting story, and I'm not afraid to hear it," she began.

"It depends," replied Dan. "What do you know about the Dark Alert game?"

"Oh, it's a popular new game. They received a lot of investment when they started incorporating AI into it."

"Right, but it's actually the third version, quite different from its predecessors. Do you know how they're using AI in this game?" Dan inquired.

"They use it to balance the game and manage bots, similar to other games," Lilla explained.

"Yes and no. In other games, bots, AI or not, don't have much information about you, your units, or your character. Game designers often dumb down the AI. But Dark Alert is different. Here, the AI doesn't have extra information; it tries to analyze what it sees and follow your orders. If it spots someone, it decides whether they're an enemy and then acts. That can lead to friendly fire because it can't always recognize allies. It's very much like a real battlefield," Dan elaborated.

"Okay, I think I get it. Please continue," Lilla encouraged.

Dan then shared his conspiracy theory, asking her not to laugh. Lilla smiled at the mention of the Reddit topic, admitting she had read it and considered investigating.

As Dan continued, Lilla's expression turned to one of horror: "Your story is frightening but fascinating. Next time, ask me out on a date, not to a new investigation."

They talked for another hour or two about AI and its potential military applications.

## Traders

On Wednesday, Dan received a message from Lilla:

"Tomorrow, 10:00."

"Okay," Dan replied.

Knowing it was during work hours, he reluctantly asked his boss for time off, dreading the ensuing conversation.

Lilla was waiting in the café, already sipping coffee when Dan arrived.

Bracing himself for disappointment, Dan was surprised as Lilla began with some unexpected news:

"I asked some well-informed contacts about those two guys. One of them, known as 'Jeremy Badi' or 'Jeremy Junior,' is a weapons trader. He's not a criminal; he deals officially with military companies and governments. He prefers crypto for his transactions," Lilla explained.

"All-knows-guys?" Dan inquired, intrigued.

"As a journalist, I have contacts in various circles, including the police and... other organizations," Lilla clarified.

"That's intriguing. But how can we use this information?" Dan pondered.

"We can't rely solely on insider knowledge. We need to find public links between these individuals," Lilla suggested.

"Like OSINT?"

"Exactly. That would be perfect."

Their conversation then shifted to discussing OSINT techniques and their application in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

## 17.

Lisbon. February.

Dan set out to locate a particular individual at the conference, approaching the task with the mindset of a spy on a mission.

He had informed his chief that he wished to attend a conference on AI. His chief, seeing the value in this, approved the request and agreed to cover the expenses as a business trip.

At the AI conference, Dan didn’t come across the specific individuals he was interested in. Instead, he found himself among members of the AI Church exclusively.

## 18.

Prague. March.

Dan attended another conference, again on a business trip. This time, the conference was centered around AI vision. There, he spotted one of the individuals he was interested in, who was actively engaged in taking photos with the speakers. Seizing the opportunity, Dan discreetly photographed all of this individual's contacts for further investigation.

However, the yield from this effort was disappointingly low.

## 19.

Berlin. April.

Dan attended a gaming competition in Berlin, drawn by his interest in the popular game "Dark Alert."

He found himself immersed in the competitive atmosphere, thoroughly enjoying and appreciating the infectious enthusiasm of the gaming community.

## 20.

Dan noticed three individuals standing aside in a dark corner, appearing out of place among the typical gaming crowd. He recognized "Jeremy Junior" and "William Thompson" among them. The third person, however, was harder to identify due to the dim lighting and the distance separating them from Dan.

He tried to move closer to capture a photo, but his attempts were unsuccessful. He could make out only some facial features, which struck a chord of familiarity, yet he couldn't quite place where he had seen them before.

## 21.

Dan returned home and began a manual search through all the photos where he might find the unknown individual. While using AI would have been easier, he didn't have a photo of the stranger, only a mental image.

He started with the photo archives from recent events but found nothing.

Next, he delved into the LinkedIn contacts of Jeremy and William, whom he had noted earlier. Unfortunately, there was no luck there either; the mysterious person wasn't in those photos.

He then turned his attention to the contacts of Umbrella Group members who had more than one mutual connection. Despite sifting through over a hundred photos, the individual remained elusive.

The last significant set of photos to check were those related to the AI Church bots. Dan decided to dedicate the upcoming weekend to this extensive task.

## 22.

During the workweek, Dan headed to the office, facing a series of mundane tasks. His job for Monday and Tuesday involved fixing scrapers for web resources, which gathered data for the AI assistant. He managed to add support for ten new resources to the scrapers. However, the monotonous work left him feeling tired and bored. In a moment of tidying up his workspace, Dan stumbled upon a newspaper featuring an article by Lilla. He reopened the newspaper and revisited the article. There, he saw a photo of the man he had noticed meeting with Jeremy and William. The photo was from a different military exhibition, but the man's name wasn't mentioned. Dan realized he had found his next lead.

He quickly texted Lilla, "I have news. Tomorrow at 10:00?"

Her prompt response was encouraging: "Ok ))"

## 23.

Lilla was already at the café, sipping her coffee, when Dan arrived. He greeted her with a simple "Hi," and without delay, began to unravel everything he had uncovered over the past three months. He then laid the newspaper featuring Lilla's article on the table, pointing to the person in the photo:

"This man was with Jeremy and William at the Game competition. I saw them heading to the VIP area, the same place where the CEO of A.V.A.M. Ltd. was earlier. It can't be just a coincidence; they're all connected."

Lilla's gaze sharpened as she studied the photo, the zeal of a hunter in her eyes:

"This is the CEO of a US military company. The name escapes me at the moment, but the company is Engines of War. They specialize in vehicles for special forces. I remember him from a military exhibition in Israel, where they unveiled their latest vehicle. I can't recall the details, but I have their advertising brochure. This investigation is getting more intriguing by the minute."

Their conversation about the investigation eventually gave way to lighter topics, and they spent the next 10 minutes chatting about the pleasant weather, the scenic river, and the charm of the city.

## 24.

It was Saturday morning, and Dan was deep in sleep.

His phone chimed with a "Ding," followed by another, then a rapid succession of "Ding. Ding. Ding."

"Oh, come on," Dan thought, groggily reaching for his phone on the bed. "Who could be disturbing me on a Saturday?"

The messages were from Lilla:

"Hi," the first message read.
"Yesterday, I was reviewing photos from the exhibition and found something intriguing. Check out the background."

She had attached a couple of photos. In them, Dan could see Steve Nyolo, the CEO of Engines of War, and Avraam Vin, the CEO of A.V.A.M. Another photo, albeit a bit blurred, clearly showed Jeremy Junior alongside Avraam Vin.

"Steve Nyolo and Avraam Vin," Lilla's text continued. "I think you're familiar with Vin. I've also spoken with my general editor."

Dan anxiously awaited her next message. It soon came:

"He's promised me the front page if I get the article ready by tomorrow."

"I've found a brochure from Engines of War. They're promoting a new vehicle with an 'intelligent turret,' equipped with AI vision for target detection and engagement."

"Hi," Dan replied, impressed. "You're doing incredible work. The article sounds promising. Is there any way I can help you further?"

"No need, thank you. You've been a huge help already. Sorry, I've got to dive into writing this article."

## 25.

Sunday, after lunch, Dan received a message from Lilla.

"Let's have coffee tomorrow at 10:00 ;)"

"Yep," Dan replied.

Stepping out of the subway station, Dan noticed a quaint flower shop. On a whim, he bought a bouquet of small spring flowers and, with a smile, made his way to the café.

Upon arrival, he was welcomed by Lilla's beaming smile.

On the table lay a newspaper, its headline boldly declaring, "You Play, They Win," with a subtitle that read, "How Gamers are Used to Train AI for Warfare."

"We won," Lilla said, her smile radiating triumph.

"Only this round," Dan replied, his tone tinged with a hint of pessimism but evidently pleased to see Lilla. He presented her with the flowers.

"It feels like a date," she remarked.

"As you suggested," he responded with a smile.

They continued to linger in the café, comfortably engaged in conversation and enjoying the moment...
