### The Side Effect.

David received a very strange result in his daily report: one of not a popular game received mention of it in every report in week. Why was it so strange? Of course, before new releases of any game, he saw the same situation. But this is not a new game, not a famous game, it is not a widespread game. It is not a new version of Stalker.

He improved his AI Assistant, and now it has a debug mode for analysing report result, and now David can easly understood why he received some result in report.

He run debug mode and received very interesting data.
He thought, AI Assistant uses every subject for analyze as independ set of data, but not. AI Assistant, because it knows every subject, uses all set of the data, and as result every invesigation's subject has affect to each other invesigation's subject.

"Mmmm, not good, not terrible" - it was citation from the mini-serial about Chernobyl

This is not good, it looks like bug, but otherwise the report was really good, and it really fit the user expectations. Ok, I will keep this in mind, but don't want to change this behaviour.

So, David answered himself for question, why he read to many times about this game - for now he has two active subject - Games and AI, and this game mentioned in the news about Games and about AI.

Strange, looks like somebody spent to much money for advertisement and promotion. David decided to looks on this game closer.

### The Dark Alert.

The game has a title The Dark Alert.
Sounds like trying to usage Red Alert title as referral, and the same wibe from this old game in the video trailers.

This new game looks like just another one first-person shooter. Authors of the game use the theme of the war between Ukraine and Russia, and they think they will achieve a success. In the game you can choose one of the two commands: UA (Ukrainian Alliance) or RU (Red Union).

David noticed good words game - UA - it is ISO code of Ukraine, and also it is Ukrainian Alliance in the game. RU - is also ISO for Russian, and Red Union in the game.

But authors missed one point - nobody wants to play by losers side.

David knows, some guys on his work also played this game, and everyone chose Ukraine side. Yep, hungarian citizens remember what a evil did the soviet union in their country, and was Russian Federation before collapsem which in fact was the successor of Soviet Union.

David deeps to world of this game, it just free to play shooter with in-game shop, for buy some skins for weapon, personage and so on.
In this game you can find many military vehicles, and also possibility simple modernization of it, like camouflage's net or other options.
And also possible to build some simple constructions like trenches and dugouts, "Fortnite for adult boys" - noticed David.

Many times authors of the game tries to attract attention to game. But without any major effect. The game still miss-balanced. To many gamers who want to play on Ukrainian side, and not for Russians. As result they received situation, when game doesn't start because Ukrainian team is full, but Russian doesn't filled to need level of members.

Next tries to restart the game - additional technical bonuses for Russian side, which should fix game balance. It was artillery strike and air strike, and other options, but it also was not enough for fix game balance.

And right now it was like new atempt. For back balance to the game authors of the game added new feature. All still the same for the UA side, but for their opponent RU, authors of game added new feature - gamer received unit with 4 troops, and gamer receieved basic controls for them, it's works very similar to real world, player just gaves orders by the voice to the microphone.

It was really interesting feature, it really looks like something new in the game world. The authors promises that bots doesn't use server data for decision making, just use their AI to analyze situation and decided what to do next.

### The advertising works

David don't like shooters, and of cause he doesn't want to play on RU side. He decided just to see the gameplay on the youtube and twitch service.

this should be enough to satisfy his curiosity.

He saw, this game really have a good feedback from real player. And AI of units have a good progress from release to release.

But he sees the players use this new feature like authors of the game didn't think. Player inside RU team start fighting each other. It looks like Battle Royale from other games, but inside one team.
It possible, because troops in unit don't know anithing about another unit. Like in real world, you as commander should know situation and have communcation with another commanders. But in result - it not a team play. Commander fight each other and use radio just to joke each other. And after this, who won tried to fight with UA team. It was strange but was to gives many fun to players.

"It looks like was real russian army, where every field commander want to received all awards alone" - think David who watched this videos.

But not this was interesting for him. David noticed how works AI in this game. He noticed, every trooper in your unit has individual AI, and he doesn't have unwatched link to another trooper in unit. So, as result, friendly fire it is possible not only between unit, but and inside troopers in unit. So it looks interesting. AI works independ and trying to analyse situation itself. And if it thinks he sees an enemy he tries to kill him.
