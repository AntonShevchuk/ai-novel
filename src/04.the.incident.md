# The Incident

The headline "Tesla AI Saves Single Mother and Her Two Children" had grabbed public attention, but to David, it presented a mystery begging to be solved. The incident occurred on a highway near Dallas, a seemingly random event turned miraculous by the intervention of AI. Yet, as David delves deeper, inconsistencies begin to surface.

His first clue comes from contrasting reports about the woman's new Tesla. A local newspaper mentions it was a recent purchase – puzzling for someone whose financial records, as David discovers, do not support such an expensive acquisition. This discrepancy leads him to question the entire narrative.

Determined to learn more about the woman, David turns to social media. Her Instagram is a carefully curated gallery of happy moments with her children and trips to tourist destinations across the USA. But it's her interactions with her ex-husband that provide a breakthrough. He frequently likes and comments on her photos, giving David a new lead.

David's search leads him to the ex-husband's Facebook profile, rich with personal photos. He meticulously analyzes each picture, eventually geo-locating the district where the woman lives. This information is the key to the next piece of the puzzle.

By exploring the social media profiles of residents in the same district, David discovers more about the woman's recent life. She worked as a waitress in a local café just two months before the incident – a fact that starkly contrasts with her ability to afford a brand-new Tesla.

The incident itself, involving an overturned tanker truck and a fire, was dramatic and dangerous.
