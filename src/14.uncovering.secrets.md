# Uncovering Secrets

Under the guise of a casual tourist, David wanders around the AI Church, discreetly using the ESP32 Marauder to scan for Wi-Fi networks. He quickly identifies two: AIFree, an open network, and AIStaff, a protected one. To his surprise, the Marauder cracks the AIStaff password almost instantly – a simple numeric sequence, a glaring security oversight.

Finding a safe spot to establish a stable Wi-Fi connection on his budget tablet proves to be challenging. Its limited range and spotty connectivity explain the low price. Nonetheless, David manages to connect to the AIStaff network and navigates to the internal employee portal.

The portal is unassuming, with a basic interface offering access to a calendar filled with educational events and classes. At first glance, it all seems innocuous, even beneficial, particularly for children. The next link leads to an issue tracking system, unfamiliar to David but seemingly an internal tool for task management.

Opening various tasks, David's initial curiosity turns to shock. Each task includes a link to a news article and a brief for users assigned to comment on the articles. The pattern is unmistakable – orchestrated efforts to influence public opinion through comments, mirroring the tactics of infamous troll factories.

Eager for more concrete evidence, David searches for tasks related to the Tesla incident. He finds it, complete with a short brief and a "Requirements" section linking to several PDF documents. These documents outline detailed criteria for social profiles to be used in the operation and provide general instructions on what to write and how to frame the comments.

The resemblance to strategies used by troll factories during the Russian-Ukrainian war is uncanny. "Holy shit," David whispers under his breath, realizing the extent of the AI Church's manipulation.

Aware of the sensitivity of the information he has uncovered, David hastily disconnects from the network and resumes his tourist facade. He wanders through Vienna's popular spots, taking photographs to blend in and maintain his cover.

As he heads back to Budapest, David's mind is racing. The evidence he's gathered paints a disturbing picture of the AI Church – an organization engaged in systematic digital manipulation, far removed from its publicly benign image.
